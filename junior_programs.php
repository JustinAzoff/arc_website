<h1> Junior Rowing </h1>


<p>
Rowing is an amazing sport that never fails to challenge the body, mind, and
soul of its participants. At Albany Rowing Center, junior rowers gain strength,
perseverance, and passion for the sport as they are coached to perform their
best and perhaps discover that their best far exceeds their original
expectations.
</p>

<p>
Junior rowing at ARC has become very competitive at New York State Scholastic
Rowing Association Championships and at the USRowing National Youth
Championships and other regional and national events. Many ARC rowers
participate in USRowing Olympic Selection Camps, go on to row in college and
compete at national and international events.
</p>

<p>
ARC recognizes that excellence does not appear but must be fostered in each
rower so that individual and team goals can be set and accomplished. Rowers of
all levels, from the beginner to the experienced, are coached to reach their
potential. Juniors ages 11-18 are all given the opportunity to learn to row and
compete.

<h2> High School Rowing </h2>
    
<p>
High School rowers, from Novice to Varsity, will row competitively in the
Spring and Fall. Non-competitive rowing is an option only in summer.
Competitive rowers are divided into appropriate groups and boats based on their
performance, erg times and commitment levels. Each group will focus on
developing technique and fitness. 
</p>

<p>
All rowers in their first year of rowing are novice rowers. These rowers work
on improving technique, erg scores and general fitness. Novices row in some
competitive regattas. Rowers are assessed regularly and evaluated for moving
into the Varsity group. The Varsity group includes those who have achieved
criteria set by the head coach, including reaching competitive erg scores,
skill levels and commitment levels. This group will practice six times a week
and compete at regional and national championships. 
</p>

<p>
Coxswains - ARC also offers students the opportunity to learn coxswain skills.
The coxswain is an essential part of sweep rowing, as essential as the rowers
themselves. The job of the coxswain is to steer the boat, help the crew keep
the cadence, calls out instructions and the stroke rating. The coxswain must be
a good communicator.
