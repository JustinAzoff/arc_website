<p>
The goal of the recreational program is to provide a safe and enjoyable
rowing opportunity for adult rowers who are not looking for a structured,
coached rowing program. The program is intended for experienced rowers who are
self-motivated and can row without coaching. The group meets three nights a
week from mid-April to early-October. Recreational rowers seeking to achieve a
competitive workout may join the adult competitive practice on Saturdays.
