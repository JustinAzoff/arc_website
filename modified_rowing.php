<p>
In the spring of 2009, Albany Rowing Center began the Modified Rowing Program
for middle school aged rowers.  There are few clubs that offer rowing for your
age group.   We intend to focus on creating a fun and safe opportunity for you
to learn the sport of rowing and the basics of competition.   Modified Rowing
is anticipated to grow and more opportunities for competition will arise.
Until then this program may be thought of as a gateway for rowing hopefuls.
</p>

<p>
The Modified Program is a first step into the high school team.  Consideration
of modified rowers needs and expectations will be given.  Rowers will emerge
with a good foundation of skill and knowledge.  Highly competitive Modified
Rowers (MODS) may be eligible to row on the High School Team at the discretion
of the Coach. Skill development in MODS will lay the groundwork for your
school's competitive High School boats able to compete in Scholastic regattas.
</p>

<p>
Because Modified rowing is developing, regatta schedules have not yet been
arranged.  More information will be available after the season gets under way.
</p>

<h2> Fall Modified Rowing </h2>
<p>
The season will begin on Sept 7 and run until Oct 31st. 
</p>
<p>
Practice will be held: Monday â€“ Thursday from 4:15 to 6:15 pm
</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>
    
<ul>
    <li> Able to tread water for 10 minutes unsupported </li>
    <li> Able to carry 30 + lbs a total of 200 yards. </li>
    <li> Running shoes </li>
    <li> A bag with spare warm clothing </li>
    <li> Non-disposable water bottle </li>
</ul>    
    
<p>
You will be expected to perform certain duties as part of your learning
experience.  If you are unable or unwilling to perform them you will be asked
to leave.  You have to be able to swim and, as a minimum, tread water for ten
minutes unsupported.  We will test this ability as the opportunity presents
itself at the Albany Bath House.  However, by joining this program you are
attesting to the fact you are an able swimmer.
</p>

<p>
You must have a reasonable amount of strength.  The average weight of 35 pounds
will be carried by each rower about 250 yards two times each practice.
Initially this can be difficult but does become easier as you do it more
frequently.
</p>

<p>
Proper clothes and non-disposable water bottles must be brought to each
practice.   As a base layer a rower usually wears a t-shirt and a pair of
spandex shorts or pants (think Under Armour).  No baggy clothing should be
worn.  Running shoes are to be brought every day.  Extra pants, shirts,
sweatshirts and socks are needed every day:  Fleece or other synthetic
polyesters are best when possible.  In terms of warm clothes, pack extra. You
will get wet at least some of the time times by splash or the rare but
occasional swamping.  Early spring rowing can get cold when you do not wear the
right clothes. You will be fine if you dress appropriately. ARC Rowing trou,
tights, uni's and hoodies are available for purchase, but are not required of
MODS. 
</p>

<h2> Safety </h2>

<p>
Safety is everyone's responsibility.  If you do not feel safe for any reason
tell the coach.  Also tell your parents.  Please try to make the environment
safe for your teammates. 
</p>

<p>
Life jackets will not be worn.  You cannot row with a life jacket.   We do
carry life jackets in our coaching launches at all times.  Should you end up in
the water for any reason, you should stay with your rowing shell.  In the event
a shell capsizes, stay with the shell and check to make sure all rowers in your
crew have come to the surface.
</p>
    
    

<h2> Weather </h2>
    
<p>
We will conduct a practice unless you are informed otherwise.  Some days we
cannot row due to wind or thunderstorms.  Land training will occur on such
days. We will row in light rain if the water is safe. Always dress
appropriately for the weather. Hats are very useful. Remember, it is usually
colder by the river.
