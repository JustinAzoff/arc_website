<h1> Join ARC in the Holiday Challenge and erg for a good cause! </h1>

<p>
Meet the challenge by rowing 100,000 or 200,000 meters between Thanksgiving Day
and Christmas Eve.  For the past few years, ARC has had 3 or 4 hardy souls
complete the 200,000 meter challenge.  This year, Concept2 will make a donation
to one of several charities based on how far you row!  So, put some meters in
for a good cause!
</p>

<p>
It's easy to participate in the challenge.  Go to
<a href="www.concept2.com">concept2.com</a> and set up a personal logbook for
yourself.  Include Albany Rowing Center as your affiliation - you'll be able to
see your and your teammates' progress in completing the challenge.  Be sure to
check off that "Yes," you want to participate in Honor Boards.  Enter your
meters in the Concept2 online logbook, and erg away!
