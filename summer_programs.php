<p>
The Albany Rowing Center Learn to Row programs offer the experience of rowing
to interested youth entering grades 6 and above. The Learn to Row Program
permits young athletes to learn about the sport of rowing through
participation. Students will learn water and boat safety, stroke mechanics on
the ergometer (rowing machine) and the basic techniques of sweep rowing. While
the majority of time is spent on the water, there is also dry land training and
education about boats and equipment.  </p>

<h2> Swim Test </h2>

<p>
The swim test can be taken at ANY POOL where a lifeguard is present.  We do not
administer swim tests at the boathouse. Please print out the
<a href="/docs/2009_Junior_Camp_Reg.pdf">registration form</a> and have a
lifeguard sign it. You can either mail the form to Albany Rowing Center OR
bring it to your first day of class. You may not be boated without the swim
test.
