<h2>The Head of the Hudson Regatta</h2>
<p>
Each year in the fall, the Albany Rowing Center hosts the Head of the Hudson
Regatta. Typical of other "head" races that are held throughout the country in
the fall, the Head of the Hudson is a three-mile race "against the clock." The
Head of the Hudson is our premier event, bringing together hundreds of
competitors from high schools, colleges and clubs from the Capital District,
other areas of New York and surrounding states. The regatta consists of thirty
or more different race events, in which adults, juniors and recreational
rowers, both novice and experienced, may compete. Competing rowers begin at a
start point three miles north of the Albany Rowing Center boathouse on the
Hudson River in Albany and, one after the other, race south to finish just past
the boathouse. The best finishing time in each race event determines the
winner. Gold and silver medals are awarded to the first and second-place
finishers in each race event, and special trophies are also awarded to winning
teams of certain sponsored races. An All-Points Trophy is awarded at the end of
the regatta to the team with the most points overall, based on placement in
each race event.

The regatta is both ARC's coveted home regatta as well as the focal point for
our fall fundraising drive. Founded in 1985, the Albany Rowing Center, located
on the Hudson River in downtown Albany, is committed to providing recreational
and competitive rowing opportunities for both youth and adults. We use
membership dues and equipment fees to meet operational expenses and coaching
salaries. We rely on fundraising activities and sponsorships to cover the costs
of the events that we host as well as to contribute toward special equipment
needs such as new oars or boats. The Albany Rowing Center is a 501(c)(3)
not-for-profit organization. Contributions are tax-deductible to the extent
allowed by law.

The 22nd Head of the Hudson Regatta was held on Saturday, September 27th, a day
when the weathermen predicted heavy rain all afternoon that never materialized.
Twenty-two rowing clubs from 18 cities and 5 states competed in the regatta.
While this year's regatta had fewer race entries than 2007, there was greater
diversity in the clubs that attended including more collegiate rowers and
several new high school entries.
