<h1> Adult Competitive </h1>

<p>
The morning competitive program is designed for experienced who want to train
hard and row competitively. The primary focus is currently on sculling in quads
and doubles; however, participants will continue training in sweep rowing at
the discretion of the coach. Rowers will compete in select regional regattas.
For 2010, the training focus will be on preparing for the FISA World Rowing
Masters Regatta in St. Catharines, Ontario, in September.

<h2>Regattas & Virtual Racing Account</h2>
<p>
The competitive program typically attends several local and regional regattas
each year.  A schedule of upcoming regattas will be posted when available. 

Virtual Racing Accounts (VRAs) are used to manage regatta fees.  <strong>Each
rower's VRA should be brought up to $175 before the start of each
season.</strong>  As you participate in races, Albany Rowing Center will deduct
the "actual cost" of attending the regatta from your VRA.  "Actual costs" are
the cumulative cost of: </p>
<ul>
    <li> Entry Fees </li>
    <li> Gas </li>
    <li> Tolls </li>
    <li> Coach's costs </li>
</ul>

<p> Divided by: </p>
<ul>
    <li> Number of racers participating in that regatta. </li>
</ul>
