<h1> Adult Learn to Row 2010 </h1>

<p>
This program is for adults interested in learning the basic techniques and
styles of sculling and sweep rowing. The program is a low impact sport
available to adults of all athletic levels. We offer five evening sessions of
two weeks each. The two week(10 day) program includes both instruction on land
and learning basic rowing technique on the water. On water activities are
dependent on weather and river conditions. After completing the basic two week
program, those interested in continuing to row will join the adult novice
program.
