<h1> Adult Learn to Row 2009 </h1>

<p>
This program is for adults interested in learning the basic techniques and
styles of sculling and sweep rowing. The program is a low impact sport
available to adults of all athletic levels. We offer four evening sessions of
four weeks each. Participants may take one, several or all scheduled sessions.
To reserve a seat for a session, please see the registration instructions
below.

<p>
To advance to rowing in other ARC programs, you need to participate in at least
one learn to row session. Advancement to the adult coached/intermediate program
is dependent upon the coach's assessment of your skill level. If you are not
quite ready after your first month, you may register for one or more two week
sessions until advanced by the coach.
