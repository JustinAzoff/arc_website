<h2> Registration Packet </h2>
<a href="/docs/WINTER TRAINING REGISTRATION FORM 09_10.pdf">Download 2009 winter program registration form</a>

<h2>Program Description</h2>
<p>
The 2009 - 2010 winter training program will prepare varsity rowers for spring
competition and improve athleticism and rowing potential for novices,
non-competitive adults and those returning to rowing after a break in training.
Although winter training attendance can be more flexible than participation in
the regular rowing season, the more you put into your participation the more
you will improve.  Winter training will take place from December 14<super>th</super>
through March 13<super>th</super> at our rented space on the first floor of 883
Broadway in Albany at the corner of Broadway and North Ferry Street.
