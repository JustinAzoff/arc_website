<h1> Programs and Camps: Visiting and Collegiate Rowers </h1>

<h2> Drop-In Rowers </h2>

<p>
ARC offers opportunity for guest rowers to row while in the Albany area.
Experienced rowers who live outside of the Capital District (Albany,
Rensselaer, Saratoga and Schenectady counties) and who are visiting the Albany
area may row in any of our adult programs while they are here. The guest rower
fees are $15 per day or $35 per week for recreational and adult intermediate,
and $45 per week for adult competitive. Guest rowers must sign an ARC waiver
and release form. As a rule, no guest may row more than 2 consecutive weeks in
one season without joining ARC as a member.
